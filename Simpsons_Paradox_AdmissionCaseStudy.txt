## Final Synopsis ##
	The overall proportion of males and females (applying for physics or chemistry) are 48.6% and 51.4% respectively, 
which shows the proportion of females applying were marginally higher as compared to males. When we look at the 
conversion rate (admission rate as compared to proportion rate), it's evident that for Physics major only 51.6% males
(as compared to proportion rate of 92.6% males) admitted in the course. 

	On the other hand, a very high 74.25% females (as compared to proportion rate of 12.1% females) got admission 
in the course which tells us that Females have a very high conversion rate as compared to Males for Physics major. 
Similarly, when we look at the conversion rate (admission rate as compared to proportion rate), it's evident that for 
Chemistry major a marginally high 11.1% males (as compared to proportion rate of 7.4% males) admitted in the course. 
On the other hand, only 22.6% females (as compared to proportion rate of 87.9% females) got admission in the course 
which tells us that here Males have a very high conversion rate as compared to Females for Chemistry major.

	Finally, if we analyse the major- wise admission rate for Physics major it's 54.29% and Chemistry major it's 
21.72% for both genders. But basis of above-mentioned gender-wise and major-wise details, we can say that Females have 
a superior conversion rate (admission rate as compared to proportion rate) when comapred with Males.
